I am a PhD student at the [Division of Systems and Control](https://www.it.uu.se/research/systems_and_control) within the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.it.uu.se) and the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://www.math.uu.se/CIM) in Uppsala, supervised by [Fredrik Lindsten](https://liu.se/en/employee/freli29), [Dave Zachariah](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davza513), and Erik Sj√∂blom.
The main focus of my PhD studies is [uncertainty-aware deep learning](http://www.math.uu.se/digitalAssets/396/c_396868-l_1-k_lindsten.pdf).

For my research I mainly use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
I try to help improving the Julia ecosystem by contributing to a broad range of opensource Julia packages.
Over the last few years I have been making major contributions to [SciML](https://sciml.ai), in particular to [DelayDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DelayDiffEq.jl), and to [Turing](https://turing.ml).
Currently I am a member of the [steering council of SciML](https://sciml.ai/governance.html) and the [Turing team](https://turing.ml/dev/team/).
