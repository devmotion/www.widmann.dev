I am a PhD student at the [Division of Systems and Control](https://www.it.uu.se/research/systems_and_control)
within the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.it.uu.se) and the
[Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://www.math.uu.se/CIM) in Uppsala,
supervised by [Fredrik Lindsten](https://liu.se/en/employee/freli29),
[Dave Zachariah](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davza513), and Erik Sj√∂blom. The main focus of my PhD studies is [uncertainty-aware deep learning](http://www.math.uu.se/digitalAssets/396/c_396868-l_1-k_lindsten.pdf).

For my research I mainly use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).
I try to help improving the Julia ecosystem by contributing to a broad range of opensource
Julia packages. Over the last few years I have been making major contributions to
[SciML](https://sciml.ai), in particular to [DelayDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/devmotion/DelayDiffEq.jl), and to [Turing](https://turing.ml).
Currently I am a member of the [steering council of SciML](https://sciml.ai/governance.html) and the [Turing team](https://turing.ml/dev/team/).
