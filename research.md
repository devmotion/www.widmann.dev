## Overview

I am a PhD student at the [Division of Systems and Control](https://www.it.uu.se/research/systems_and_control)
within the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.it.uu.se) and the
[Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://www.math.uu.se/CIM) in Uppsala,
supervised by [Fredrik Lindsten](https://liu.se/en/employee/freli29),
[Dave Zachariah](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davza513), and Erik Sjöblom. The main focus of my PhD studies is [uncertainty-aware deep learning](http://www.math.uu.se/digitalAssets/396/c_396868-l_1-k_lindsten.pdf). Currently, I
am particularly interested in analyzing and evaluating
[calibration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibration_(statistics)) of
probabilistic models.

For my Master's thesis in Mathematics at TU Munich, I explored a delay
differential equation system of quorum sensing in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. For the numerical analysis of the investigated system I used
and contributed to
[DelayDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DelayDiffEq.jl), a delay
differential equation solver in the Julia programming language.

Moreover, during my Master's studies I worked on a research project at
the
[Institute of Computational Biology](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/index.html),
Munich, and investigated post-translational histone modifications using
[hidden Markov models](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/038612v1).

During my medical studies at LMU Munich I was part of a research group
at the
[Center of Neuropathology](https://www.en.neuropathologie.med.uni-muenchen.de/index.html),
Munich, and performed sequencing and imaging analysis of 5-hmC in brain
tumours.
